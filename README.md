Being active in the r/unixporn Linux community for some time now, I noticed that users often decorate their desktops with color palettes like Nord, Gruvbox, Catpuccin, etc., and I was frustrated that no one took care of such a beautiful color palette as Nightfox, and that's how my project was created. Wallpapers adapted to the Nightfox palette in different variants ðŸ˜€, at the moment I plan to take care of Duskfox, Nordfox, Carbonfox and Terafox variants. Dayfox and Dawnfox maybe sometime in the future when I am convinced to lighter themes ðŸ˜‰
